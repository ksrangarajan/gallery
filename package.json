Introduction to problem:

Handling large amounts of tabular data and datasets is a common challenge in many applications.
The goal is to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data, without using excessive memory or storage space.
The solution proposed is to implement an in-memory data structure with virtual loading capabilities.
This approach allows data to be loaded on demand, reducing the amount of memory required.
The use of an in-memory data structure enables fast data retrieval times, making real-time processing of large datasets possible.
The potential benefits of this approach include improved performance, scalability, and efficiency.
Introduction :
In many applications, it is often required to handle large amounts of tabular data (e.g. in the form of a table or a spreadsheet), where each row represents an instance and each column represents a feature. Storing this data in memory can be challenging due to the limited memory resources available. One common solution is to divide the data into smaller chunks and load only the needed chunks into memory, which is known as "virtual loading" or "on-demand loading". 

Proposed Solution :
A high-level overview of the steps involved in implementing an in-memory tabular data structure with virtual loading capabilities.
The solution is to implement a data structure that can handle the data on demand, meaning that only a portion of the data is loaded into memory at any given time and the way to achieve this is through virtual loading and on-demand loading.
Implement virtual loading techniques to ensure that only the data that is required is loaded into memory at any given time.
Store the data in an in-memory data structure, such as RAM, to ensure fast data retrieval times.
Optimize the data structure for efficient memory usage, for example, by using data compression techniques or reducing the size of data structures used to store metadata.

Tabular Data Structure:
A tabular data structure is a two-dimensional data structure that consists of rows and columns. In this context, each row represents a single record and each column represents a field or attribute of that record. The tabular data structure is often used to represent relational databases, spreadsheets, and other data sources that can be represented in a tabular format.
On-Demand Loading:
On-demand loading is a technique where the data is loaded into memory only when it is required. This means that the data structure only loads a portion of the data into memory at any given time, thereby reducing the memory requirements. To implement on-demand loading, we can add a method to the data structure that loads a specific range of rows into memory. This method can be triggered when the user attempts to access data that is not currently loaded into memory.
Virtual Loading:
Virtual loading is a technique where the data structure appears to have all the data loaded into memory, but in reality, only a portion of the data is actually loaded. This technique is often used to reduce the memory requirements of the data structure. To implement virtual loading, we can create a virtual view of the data that appears to have all the data loaded into memory, but in reality, only a portion of the data is actually loaded. When the user attempts to access data that is not currently loaded, the virtual view can trigger the on-demand loading method to load the necessary data into memory.

Future State :

Business Benefit :

Improved Performance: By using an in-memory data structure and virtual loading techniques, data retrieval times can be significantly reduced, enabling real-time processing of large datasets.
Increased Scalability: The virtual loading approach allows for the efficient handling of very large datasets, without requiring excessive amounts of memory or storage space.
Better Resource Utilization: By minimizing the amount of memory required to store and retrieve data, resources can be used more efficiently, reducing costs and improving overall performance.

Conclusion :
In conclusion, implementing an in-memory tabular data structure for handling large data with virtual loading is a valuable solution for many data-intensive applications. By leveraging the speed and efficiency of in-memory storage and virtual loading techniques, businesses can ensure fast data retrieval times and efficiently handle large datasets without requiring excessive amounts of memory or storage space.
